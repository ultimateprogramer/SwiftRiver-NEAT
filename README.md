SWIFTRIVER
==========
 
SwiftRiver is a FOSS platform offering open source intelligence products for monitoring streams of data. Use of the platform varies, for example, one use might be to use one of our apps for determining the accuracy of crowdsourced information related to an event or topic.  This download is not 'SwiftRiver' it contains a PHP core that accesses a number of SwiftRiver APIs.  The combination of some or all of these APIs working together is our platform.

Swift is extremely modular with plug-ins and API services.  Different apps are built on this platform. This download contains our flagship app, called The Sweeper, designed to help users of tools like Ushahidi manage large amounts of realtime information.
